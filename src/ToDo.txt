Items to be done:
- Restructure code into additional classes
- Reduce code duplication


Bugs:
- Select empty directory, then click app buttons.
- Select empty directory first, then try to select a directory with images.




Notes from CP:

SOLID

class - directory of photos
will have array that contains photo objects
1 - needs path to directory
2 - list (linked list?) of photo
	-the image file
	-name of the file
	-boolean - keep or not
